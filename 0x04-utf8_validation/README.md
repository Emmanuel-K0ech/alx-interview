# 0x04. UTF-8 Validation

For the **"0x04. UTF-8 Validation"** project, you will need to apply your knowledge in bitwise operations, understanding the UTF-8 encoding scheme, and Python programming skills to validate whether a given dataset represents a valid UTF-8 encoding.

## Concepts Needed

### Bitwise Operations in Python
- Understanding how to manipulate bits in Python, including operations like AND (`&`), OR (`|`), XOR (`^`), NOT (`~`), and shifts (`<<`, `>>`).
- **Resources**:
  - [Python Bitwise Operators](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bitwise-operations-on-integer-types)

### UTF-8 Encoding Scheme
- Familiarity with the UTF-8 encoding rules, including how characters are encoded into one or more bytes.
- Understanding the patterns that represent a valid UTF-8 encoded character.
- **Resources**:
  - [UTF-8 (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8)
  - [Characters, Symbols, and the Unicode Miracle](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2003/10/08/the-absolute-minimum-every-software-developer-absolutely-positively-must-know-about-unicode-and-character-sets-no-excuses/)

### Data Representation
- How to represent and work with data at the byte level.
- Handling the least significant bits (LSB) of integers to simulate byte data.

### List Manipulation in Python
- Iterating through lists, accessing list elements, and understanding list comprehensions.
- **Resources**:
  - [Python Lists](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#more-on-lists)

### Boolean Logic
- Applying logical operations to make decisions within the program.

By studying these concepts and utilizing the resources provided, you will be equipped to tackle the UTF-8 validation project, effectively applying bitwise operations and logical reasoning to determine the validity of UTF-8 encoded data.
