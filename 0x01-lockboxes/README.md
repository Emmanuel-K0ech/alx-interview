# 0x01. Lockboxes Must Know

## Overview
For this project, you will need a solid understanding of several key concepts to develop a solution that efficiently determines if all boxes can be opened. Below are the concepts and resources essential to tackling this project.

## Concepts Needed

### 1. Lists and List Manipulation
- Understand how to work with lists, including accessing elements, iterating over lists, and modifying them dynamically.
- **Resource:** [Python Lists (Python Official Documentation)](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html)

### 2. Graph Theory Basics
- Although not explicitly required, knowledge of graph theory, especially traversal algorithms like Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS), can be helpful. The boxes and keys can be thought of as nodes and edges in a graph.
- **Resource:** [Graph Theory (Khan Academy)](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms)

### 3. Algorithmic Complexity
- Understanding time and space complexity is important for writing more efficient algorithms.
- **Resource:** [Big O Notation (GeeksforGeeks)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/analysis-of-algorithms-set-1-asymptotic-analysis/)

### 4. Recursion
- Some solutions might require a recursive approach to traverse through the boxes and keys.
- **Resource:** [Recursion in Python (Real Python)](https://realpython.com/python-recursion/)

### 5. Queue and Stack
- Knowing how to use queues and stacks is crucial when implementing BFS or DFS algorithms for traversal.
- **Resource:** [Python Queue and Stack (GeeksforGeeks)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/queue-in-python/)

### 6. Set Operations
- Using sets to keep track of visited boxes and available keys can optimize your search process.
- **Resource:** [Python Sets (Python Official Documentation)](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#sets)

## Additional Resources
- **Mock Technical Interview:** Practice your problem-solving skills by conducting mock technical interviews related to this project.

## Requirements

### General
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All files will be interpreted/compiled on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** using **python3 (version 3.4.3)**
- All files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A `README.md` file at the root of the folder is mandatory
- Your code should be well-documented
- Your code should follow the **PEP 8 style** (version 1.7.x)
- All files must be executable
