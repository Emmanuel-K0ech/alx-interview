# 0x05. N Queens

The **N Queens** project is a classic problem in computer science and mathematics. It involves placing **N non-attacking queens** on an **N×N chessboard**, leveraging the backtracking algorithm to explore all potential solutions.

## Concepts Needed

### Backtracking Algorithms
- **Definition**: A systematic way to explore all possible solutions by building a solution incrementally and backtracking when a solution cannot be completed.
- **Key Resource**: [Backtracking Introduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtracking)

### Recursion
- **Definition**: A programming technique where a function calls itself to solve sub-problems of the original problem.
- **Key Resource**: [Recursion in Python](https://realpython.com/python-recursion/)

### List Manipulations in Python
- **Usage**: Creating and manipulating lists, especially to store the positions of queens on the board.
- **Key Resource**: [Python Lists](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html)

### Python Command Line Arguments
- **Usage**: Handling input via the command line using the `sys` module.
- **Key Resource**: [Command Line Arguments in Python](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.argv)
