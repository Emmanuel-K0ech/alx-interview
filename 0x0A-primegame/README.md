# 0x0A. Prime Game

## Project Overview
In this project, you'll apply your understanding of **prime numbers**, **game theory**, and **algorithm optimization** to solve a competitive game scenario. The challenge revolves around determining the winner based on the strategic removal of prime numbers and their multiples from a sequence of consecutive integers.

## Concepts You Need to Know

### Prime Numbers
- **Definition**: Numbers greater than 1 with no divisors other than 1 and themselves.
- Efficient algorithms for identifying prime numbers within a given range.

### Sieve of Eratosthenes
- An efficient method to find all prime numbers up to a specified limit.
- Particularly useful for precomputing prime numbers in this project.

### Game Theory
- **Principles of Competitive Games**:
  - Players take turns.
  - Each player aims to maximize their chances of winning.
- Understanding **win conditions** and strategies for optimal play.

### Dynamic Programming/Memoization
- Leveraging precomputed results to optimize calculations for subsequent rounds.
- Crucial for managing multiple rounds efficiently.

### Python Programming
- Utilizing loops and conditionals to implement the game logic.
- Managing integers and removed numbers using lists and arrays.
