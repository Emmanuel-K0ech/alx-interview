# 0x03. Log Parsing

For the **0x03. Log Parsing** project, you will need to apply Python programming skills, focusing on real-time data stream parsing and processing. This project involves reading from standard input (stdin), processing data in a specific format, and performing calculations based on the input data.

## Concepts Needed

### 1. File I/O in Python
- **Objective**: Learn how to read from `sys.stdin` line by line.
- **Resources**:
  - [Python Input and Output](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html)

### 2. Signal Handling in Python
- **Objective**: Manage keyboard interruptions (e.g., CTRL + C) using Python's signal handling.
- **Resources**:
  - [Python Signal Handling](https://docs.python.org/3/library/signal.html)

### 3. Data Processing
- **Objective**: 
  - Parse strings to extract specific data points.
  - Aggregate data to compute summaries.
- **Resources**:
  - [Data Processing in Python](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datatypes.html#sequence-types-list-tuple-range)

### 4. Regular Expressions
- **Objective**: Use regular expressions to validate and match the format of each line.
- **Resources**:
  - [Python Regular Expressions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html)

### 5. Dictionaries in Python
- **Objective**: Use dictionaries to count occurrences of status codes and accumulate file sizes.
- **Resources**:
  - [Python Dictionaries](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries)

### 6. Exception Handling
- **Objective**: Handle exceptions that may arise during file reading and data processing.
- **Resources**:
  - [Python Exceptions](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html)

By studying these concepts and utilizing the resources provided, you will be prepared to handle data streams, parse log entries, and compute metrics based on processed data effectively.

## Requirements

### General
- **Allowed Editors**: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- **Environment**: All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3 (version 3.4.3)
- **File Requirements**:
  - All files must end with a new line.
  - The first line of all files should be `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
  - A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory.
  - Code should follow the PEP 8 style guide (version 1.7.x).
  - All files must be executable.
  - The length of files will be tested using `wc`.
