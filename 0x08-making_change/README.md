# 0x08. Making Change

## Project Overview

In the **“0. Change comes from within”** project, you will solve the **coin change problem**, a classic challenge in dynamic programming and greedy algorithms. The objective is to determine the **minimum number of coins** required to make a given amount, given a list of coin denominations. This project emphasizes applying algorithmic strategies to craft a solution that is **both correct and efficient**.

## Key Concepts

### Greedy Algorithms
- Understanding how greedy algorithms work and why they might be suitable for the coin change problem.
- Recognizing limitations of greedy algorithms and scenarios where they may fail to provide the optimal solution.

### Dynamic Programming
- Grasping the principles of dynamic programming as a method for solving optimization problems.
- Exploring the concepts of **overlapping subproblems** and **optimal substructure** in the coin change problem.

### Algorithmic Complexity
- Analyzing the **time complexity** and **space complexity** of different approaches.
- Striving for solutions with lower complexity to meet runtime constraints.

### Problem-Solving Strategies
- Breaking the problem into smaller, manageable sub-problems.
- Comparing **iterative** vs **recursive** approaches in dynamic programming.

### Python Programming
- Leveraging Python features such as:
  - List manipulation and list comprehensions.
  - Efficient looping and conditional statements.
- Implementing functions with clarity and efficiency.
